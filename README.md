# py-sparql
Web interface for running SPARQL queries on RDFLib

# How to use
1 - Clone this repo
2 - Create a venv inside it
3 - install pip requirements
4 - run start.sh
Important: if you press Ctrl+C to stop the script start.sh, the processes may still be running, so you have to kill them manually (I don't care enough to make it automatic :) ).
